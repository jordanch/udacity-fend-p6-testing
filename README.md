Udacity Project 6 - JavaScript testing using Jasmine

About:

Jasmine is a JavaScript testing library. The project revolved around creating Test Suites and Test Specs to carry out "unit tests" - tests on small pieces of the application's logic. This was the first time I had been exposed to a testing framework and enjoyed learning about Jasmine, specifically asynchronous function testing.

Q: How can I run the application?

A:
1. Navigate using your file explorer to the root folder ("*/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader/")
2. Open index.html with your browser (preferably Google Chrome)
3. The Jasmine Test Suites will automatically run after opening index.html, afterwhich you can review the results at the bottom of the application page
