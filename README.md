Q: How can I run the application?

A:
1. Navigate using your file explorer to the root folder ("*/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader/")
2. Open index.html with your browser (preferably Google Chrome)
3. The Jasmine Test Suites will automatically run after opening index.html, afterwhich you can review the results at the bottom of the application page
